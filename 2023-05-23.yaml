      description: Teltonika’s Remote Management System versions 4.14.0 is vulnerable to an unauthorized attacker registering previously unregistered devices through the RMS platform. If the user has not disabled the "RMS management feature" enabled by default, then an attacker could register that device to themselves. This could enable the attacker to perform different operations on the user's devices, including remote code execution with 'root' privileges (using the 'Task Manager' feature on RMS).

      description: Teltonika’s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 have a feature allowing users to access managed devices’ local secure shell (SSH)/web management services over the cloud proxy. A user can request a web proxy and obtain a URL in the Remote Management System cloud subdomain. This URL could be shared with others without Remote Management System authentication . An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to create a malicious webpage that uses a trusted and certified domain. An attacker could initiate a reverse shell when a victim connects to the malicious webpage, achieving remote code execution on the victim device.

      description: Teltonika’s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 contain a function that allows users to claim their devices. This function returns information based on whether the serial number of a device has already been claimed, the MAC address of a device has already been claimed, or whether the attempt to claim a device was successful. An attacker could exploit this to create a list of the serial numbers and MAC addresses of all devices cloud-connected to the Remote Management System.

      description: An issue was discovered in KaiOS 3.0 before 3.1. The /system/bin/tctweb_server binary exposes a local web server that responds to GET and POST requests on port 2929. The server accepts arbitrary Bash commands and executes them as root. Because it is not permission or context restricted and returns proper CORS headers, it's accessible to all websites via the browser. At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to retrieve a list of the user's installed apps, notifications, and downloads. It also allows an attacker to delete local files and modify system properties including the boolean persist.moz.killswitch property (which would render the device inoperable). This vulnerability is partially mitigated by SELinux which prevents reads, writes, or modifications to files or permissions within protected partitions.

      description: The fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete for Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M2 to 11.0.0-M4, 10.1.5 to 10.1.7, 9.0.71 to 9.0.73 and 8.5.85 to 8.5.87. If non-default HTTP       connector settings were used such that the maxParameterCount could be reached using query string parameters and a request was       submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount parameters in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could be bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.
