      description: Pay is a payments engine for Ruby on Rails 6.0 and higher. In versions prior to 6.3.2 a payments info page of Pay is susceptible to reflected Cross-site scripting. An attacker could create a working URL that renders a javascript link to a user on a Rails application that integrates Pay. This URL could be distributed via email to specifically target certain individuals. If the targeted application contains a functionality to submit user-generated content (such as comments) the attacker could even distribute the URL using that functionality. This has been patched in version 6.3.2 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

When debug-formatted, it would include a user's AWS access key, AWS secret key, and security token in plaintext. When TRACE-level logging is enabled for an SDK, `SigningParams` is printed, thereby revealing those credentials to anyone with access to logs. All users of the AWS SDK for Rust who enabled TRACE-level logging, either globally (e.g. `RUST_LOG=trace`), or for the `aws-sigv4` crate specifically are affected. This issue has been addressed in a set of new releases. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable TRACE-level logging for AWS Rust SDK crates.

Additionally, it is not possible to explicitly save an empty security context to the HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository. This vulnerability can keep users authenticated even after they performed logout. Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation. 5.7.x users should upgrade to 5.7.8. 5.8.x users should upgrade to 5.8.3. 6.0.x users should upgrade to 6.0.3.
