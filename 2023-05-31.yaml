      description: Emby Server is a user-installable home media server which stores and organizes a user's media files of virtually any format and makes them available for viewing at home and abroad on a broad range of client devices. This vulnerability may allow administrative access to an Emby Server system, depending on certain user account settings. By spoofing certain headers which are intended for interoperation with reverse proxy servers, it may be possible to affect the local/non-local network determination to allow logging in without password or to view a list of user accounts which may have no password configured. Impacted are all Emby Server system which are publicly accessible and where the administrator hasn't tightened the account login configuration for administrative users. This issue has been patched in Emby Server Beta version 4.8.31 and Emby Server version 4.7.12.

    - id: CVE-2023-33975
      description: RIOT-OS, an operating system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. In version 2023.01 and prior, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in an out of bounds write in the packet buffer. The overflow can be used to corrupt other packets and the allocator metadata. Corrupting a pointer will easily lead to denial of service. While carefully manipulating the allocator metadata gives an attacker the possibility to write data to arbitrary locations and thus execute arbitrary code. This issue is fixed in pull request 19680. As a workaround, disable support for fragmented IP datagrams.

        JStachio is a  type-safe Java Mustache templating engine. Prior to version 1.0.1, JStachio fails to escape single quotes `'` in HTML, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users visiting pages that use this template engine. This can lead to various consequences, including session hijacking, defacement of web pages, theft of sensitive information, or even the propagation of malware.

        Version 1.0.1 contains a patch for this issue. To mitigate this vulnerability, the template engine should properly escape special characters, including single quotes. Common practice is to escape `'` as `&#39`. As a workaround, users can avoid this issue by using only double quotes `"` for HTML attributes.

      description: |-
        Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.

        An additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.

        The fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default.

      description: Lima launches Linux virtual machines, typically on macOS, for running containerd. Prior to version 0.16.0, a virtual machine instance with a malicious disk image could read a single file on the host filesystem, even when no filesystem is mounted from the host. The official templates of Lima and the well-known third party products (Colima, Rancher Desktop, and Finch) are unlikely to be affected by this issue. To exploit this issue, the attacker has to embed the target file path (an absolute or a relative path from the instance directory) in a malicious disk image, as the qcow2 (or vmdk) backing file path string. As Lima refuses to run as the root, it is practically impossible for the attacker to read the entire host disk via `/dev/rdiskN`. Also, practically, the attacker cannot read at least the first 512 bytes (MBR) of the target file. The issue has been patched in Lima in version 0.16.0 by prohibiting using a backing file path in the VM base image.

      description: |-
        Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or
        data containing them may be very slow.

        Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of
        the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message
        size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those
        messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.

        An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -
        most of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate
        an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL
        type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the
        sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by
        periods.

        When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large
        (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds
        of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long
        time.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the
        sub-identifiers in bytes (*).

        With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /
        identifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT
        IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching
        algorithms.

        Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure
        AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify
        what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or
        decrypt, or digest passed data.

        Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are
        affected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose
        of display, the severity is considered low.

        In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,
        CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509
        certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.

        The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a
        100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only
        impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client
        authentication.

        In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,
        such as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way
        that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered
        not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,
        and the severity is therefore considered low.
