      description: tgstation-server is a toolset to manage production BYOND servers. Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to 5.12.1, instance users with the list chat bots permission can read chat bot connections strings without the associated permission.

Invalidate any credentials previously stored for safety.

The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes the umask of the whole process for a very short period of time; a race condition with another thread can lead to a permanent umask 0 setting. Such a race condition could lead to implicit directory creation with permissions 0777 (without the sticky bit), which means that any low-privileged local user can delete and rename files inside those directories.
